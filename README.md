# Extracting the amount of defects in silicon wafers through SRH lifetime curves with machine learning models.

Bulk defects are highly critical on the efficiency of silicon solar cells. Bulk defects follow the Shockley-Read-Hall recombination statistics. Currently, there can be one single defect, two single defect, or one component with two level defects, however, they are hard to distinguish. This problem ought to be tackled due to the importance they have and the potential problems this could be solved. Because of this, a machine learning model is created to solve this.

I am currently a student experimenting with a simple understanding and knowledge on the topic of Neural Networks, I know a bit about defects in silicon wafers due to my father's studies. This repository is just for experimenting and learning a bit more about these topics, I am no expert in any of these areas.

**Generating the dataset**

The dataset ("metadatac.csv") has 5 different columns. SRH lifetime curves show carrier excess concentration ("Î”n"),
